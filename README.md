# Meeting capture

Working name (the product name is still open). A Windows tray app that nudges you to turn Teams
transcription on, captures each transcript through your own headless Claude Code session, has Claude
write a summary whose every item cites the transcript with a checked quote, and keeps every meeting
as plain files in a library folder.

Status: walking skeleton (Outline ticket 01). v1 is single-user.

## Build and run

Needs Node 20+, Rust stable (MSVC) with `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH, and WebView2 (Windows 11 has it).

```
npm install
npx tauri dev                      # iterate
npx tauri build                    # installer: <target>/release/bundle/nsis/Meeting capture_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe
npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle  # what the E2E suite runs: <target>/debug/meeting-capture.exe
cargo build -p fake-claude         # the fake claude: <target>/debug/fake-claude.exe
```

`<target>` is `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` if set, else `target/` at the repo root.

## Test

`npm run check` runs everything and exits non-zero on any failure: `cargo llvm-cov` over the workspace
(fails under 80% Rust line coverage, `MC_COVERAGE_MIN` overrides the threshold), Vitest, the debug
build, the fake claude, then the WebdriverIO E2E suite (`npm run e2e`, or `node e2e/run.mjs <spec-name>`).
It installs `llvm-tools-preview` and `cargo-llvm-cov` if missing; `@wdio/tauri-service` installs
`tauri-driver` and a matching `msedgedriver` on first run. Close any running Meeting capture first
(single instance).

Test-only env vars (D36, D37):

| Var | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_DATA_DIR` | replaces `%APPDATA%\com.lawls91.meetingcapture` (settings, `runs`) |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_HOME` | replaces the home used for `~/.claude` |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_CLAUDE` | the claude CLI to run (default `claude` on PATH) |
| `FAKE_CLAUDE_SCENARIO` | scenario file for the fake claude; it appends a record to `<scenario>.record.jsonl` |
