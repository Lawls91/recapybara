# Meeting capture

Working name (the product name is still open). A Windows tray app that nudges you to turn Teams
transcription on, captures each transcript through your own headless Claude Code session, has Claude
write a summary whose every item cites the transcript with a checked quote, and keeps every meeting
as plain files in a library folder.

Status: walking skeleton (Outline ticket 01). v1 is single-user.

## Build and run

Needs Node 20+, Rust stable (MSVC) with `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH, and WebView2 (Windows 11 has it).

```
npm install
npx tauri dev                      # iterate
npm run msi                        # installer: out/Meeting capture-0.1.0.msi (see Install)
npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle  # what the E2E suite runs: <target>/debug/meeting-capture.exe
cargo build -p fake-claude         # the fake claude: <target>/debug/fake-claude.exe
```

`<target>` is `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` if set, else `target/` at the repo root.

## Install

`npm run msi` (needs PowerShell 7 and the .NET SDK) builds the release app with `npx tauri build --no-bundle`, then a
per-user MSI with the WiX 5.0.2 dotnet global tool, which it installs from NuGet if missing:
`out/<productName>-<version>.msi`. Tauri's own bundler is off (`bundle.active: false`). Double-click the MSI, or run
`msiexec /i "out\Meeting capture-0.1.0.msi"`: no UAC prompt; it is unsigned, so SmartScreen may ask once.

- Installs `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\com.lawls91.meetingcapture\meeting-capture.exe`, a Start-menu shortcut named after
  `productName` (AUMID `com.lawls91.meetingcapture`, the toast identity) and the HKCU Run value
  `com.lawls91.meetingcapture` (start at logon, D31).
- Renaming: change `productName` only, rebuild, install over the old build. The fixed UpgradeCode makes it an in-place
  upgrade: one Apps & features entry, the new name on the shortcut and window title, settings kept.
- Uninstall (Apps & features) removes the exe, the shortcut and the Run value. Settings
  (`%APPDATA%\com.lawls91.meetingcapture`) and the library stay.
- The frozen values in `installer/wix/Package.wxs` (D50) are pinned by a test in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

## Test

`npm run check` runs everything and exits non-zero on any failure: `cargo llvm-cov` over the workspace
(fails under 80% Rust line coverage, `MC_COVERAGE_MIN` overrides the threshold), Vitest, the debug
build, the fake claude, then the WebdriverIO E2E suite (`npm run e2e`, or `node e2e/run.mjs <spec-name>`).
It installs `llvm-tools-preview` and `cargo-llvm-cov` if missing; `@wdio/tauri-service` installs
`tauri-driver` and a matching `msedgedriver` on first run. Close any running Meeting capture first
(single instance).

Test-only env vars (D36, D37):

| Var | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_DATA_DIR` | replaces `%APPDATA%\com.lawls91.meetingcapture` (settings, `runs`) |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_HOME` | replaces the home used for `~/.claude` |
| `MEETING_CAPTURE_CLAUDE` | the claude CLI to run (default `claude` on PATH) |
| `FAKE_CLAUDE_SCENARIO` | scenario file for the fake claude; it appends a record to `<scenario>.record.jsonl` |

## Library

Each meeting is a folder in the library, `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm <Subject>`, holding `meeting.json` and, once there
is one, `transcript.vtt` exactly as imported. The list reads every folder with a `meeting.json`; every field
defaults, so a test or a QA run can seed a state by hand:

```json
{ "subject": "Backlog Refinement", "start": "2026-11-05T13:00:00+00:00", "end": "2026-11-05T14:00:00+00:00",
  "state": "noTranscript", "organiser": "Robin Sample", "attendees": ["Speaker A"], "joinUrl": "https://teams.example/x" }
```

`state` is one of `scheduled`, `inCall`, `awaitingTranscript`, `noTranscript`, `notReachable`, `captureFailed`,
`transcriptReady`, `summarising`, `done`, `summaryFailed`, `skipped`. A `summary.md` in the folder makes the
summary action read "Re-run summary". Settings' Appearance (`appearance`: `system`, `light`, `dark`) picks the theme.
